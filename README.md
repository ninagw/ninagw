# Hello, I am Nina 🙂

### About me
> I have always been fascinated by websites and new technologies. But it was only through my master's degree in 2022 that I discovered my love for coding. Since then, the topic has stuck with me and I started teaching myself programming via Udemy, Bootcamps and YouTube. I would love to become a web3 / blockchain developer one day. 🔮
