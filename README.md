# Hello 🙂

### About me
> I have always been fascinated by websites and new technologies. But it was only through my master's degree in 2022 that I discovered my love for coding. Since then, the topic has stuck with me and I started teaching myself programming via Udemy, Bootcamp and YouTube. I would love to become a web3 / blockchain developer one day. 🔮

### My tech stack
- HTML
- CSS 
- Javascript
